pcat - Parallel Cat

Simple C port of a perl script I've had for a while (included) that, given a
command (with optional args), forks off a number of copies of it and 
distributes lines from stdin to the child processes.

You may specify "%%" anywhere in the command to have it be replaced with
the equivalent of sprintf('%02d', <process number starting from 1>)
