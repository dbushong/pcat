pcat - Parallel Cat

Simple C port of a perl script I've had for a while (included) that, given a
command (with optional args), forks off a number of copies of it and 
distributes lines from stdin to the child processes.

You may specify -o output-template, where the output-template will be run
through sprintf with an integer argument, so you should include a %d, %02d, 
whatever.
